<!--more-->

I love learning. I spend a lot of time reading and trying to understand how
things work. There's a part of me that thinks a career in academia would be
awesome.

But I have a tendency to get a bit defensive and uncomfortable when I'm wrong. I
think most people do. Whether someone else pointed out my mistake or it was just
me realizing how I screwed up, I feel a little embarrassed.

Lately I've been trying to remind myself that the moment you realize you're
wrong is one of the biggest opportunities for learning. I've read plenty of
things in books that didn't quite stick, especially on the first pass, but
rarely have I made the same mistake twice. The lessons I've learned by being
wrong get embedded into my brain, even if I was embarrassed at the time.

So I've decided to try to embrace being wrong, to love it even. To thank the
people who point out my mistakes like I would thank a teacher. I've decided that
if you love learning, you should love being wrong.
