title: Implementing Calendar Aggregation
---
<!--more-->

The goal is to create a service that supports the following workflows:
- Users can link their personal calendars to the service and get an aggregated calendar link out the other side.
- The aggregation should allow users to be in multiple family groups and still get just one calendar link out.
    - Maybe that's not neccessary.  It could be beneficial to get have separate calendar exports so they can label them as Family A and Family B.
