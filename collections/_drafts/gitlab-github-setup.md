title: GitHub AND GitLab
---
<!--more-->

This isn't a GitHub vs GitLab post.  There are plenty of those on the internet 
written by people who have probably done more research on the feature 
differences than I have.

This is an overview of why and more importantly how I use GitLab and GitHub 
together.  I'll touch on why I've decided to multihome my repositories but the 
reasons aren't super important.  Other people might be multihoming for 
completely different reasons.  Maybe it's just me.

I'm mainly writing this for me.  I've been using both GitHub and GitLab since 
2018 and the whole time I was telling myself that it was a trial period.  At the 
end I'd pick one and stick with it.  Here we are.  I've now decided to embrace 
the multihoming approach and define some clear guidelines on what goes into 
GitHub and what goes into GitLab.  This post is me forcing myself to write 
those guidelines down.

## Why I use GitHub

## Why I use GitLab

## Repo mirroring

What I'm using and why.  I'm writing this for myself, it's helpful to define a way of working and stick to it, especially when working on your own.

Document how I'm setting up GitLab - GitHub mirroring and how I decide which one is the home base for a specific project.

This will be a good push to clean up both of those accounts.
