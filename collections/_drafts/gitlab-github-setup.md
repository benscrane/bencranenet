title: GitHub GitLab Setup

<!--more-->

What I'm using and why.  I'm writing this for myself, it's helpful to define a way of working and stick to it, especially when working on your own.

Document how I'm setting up GitLab - GitHub mirroring and how I decide which one is the home base for a specific project.

This will be a good push to clean up both of those accounts.
