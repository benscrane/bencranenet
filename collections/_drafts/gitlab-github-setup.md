title: GitHub AND GitLab
---
<!--more-->

This isn't a GitHub vs GitLab post.  There are plenty of those on the internet 
written by people who have probably done more research on the feature 
differences than I have.

This is an overview of why and more importantly how I use GitLab and GitHub 
together.  I'll touch on why I've decided to multihome my repositories but the 
reasons aren't super important.  Other people might be multihoming for 
completely different reasons.  Maybe it's just me.

I'm mainly writing this for me.  I've been using both GitHub and GitLab since 
2018 and the whole time I was telling myself that it was a trial period.  At the 
end I'd pick one and stick with it.  Here we are.  I've now decided to embrace 
the multihoming approach and define some clear guidelines on what goes into 
GitHub and what goes into GitLab.  This post is me forcing myself to write 
those guidelines down.

## Why I use GitLab

## Why I use GitHub

GitHub is a social platform for developers.  It's also a great place to host 
your with a rich SDLC feature set.  For me though, I prefer the features at 
GitLab which is why GitLab is the main home for my active projects.  But I 
think there's a lot of value for having a strong GitHub presence as a 
developer.  

Almost all of the software development job applications that I've seen have a 
field to include your GitHub profile link or username.  I'm sure you can 
include a GitLab link there or elsewhere in your application but it just 
illustrates that GitHub is the default.

This is a living document and I'll be updating it as my approach evolves.
