After experiencing the pain of managing a local development environment when jumping between a number of side projects and work projects I'm definitely ready to find a development environment in the cloud solution.

I've been curious to try out GitHub copilot but haven't had a real drive to do it. Figuring out if I could make it work within Gitpod was enough to make me try it.

Well, it turns out you can't install the GitHub Copilot extension in Gitpod because the extension isn't open source.

First, I recommend turning off VS Code autosave. If you're running a dev server while you're editing your files, autosave results in a noisy terminal window.

How to set up Gitpod to use the GitHub Copilot extension.
Try the extension on a svelte project.
