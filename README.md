# jekyll-fun

In kind of a spin-off of [fun](https://github.com/joeybeninghove/fun), this is a
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) starter kit that can be used to quickly build
out a production-ready Jekyll static site.

## Features

* [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) for managing all of the assets
* [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) baked in for utility-first CSS
* [Stimulus](https://stimulusjs.org/) as a lightweight javascript framework
* [PostCSS](https://github.com/postcss/postcss) used to load Tailwind and make
    [postcss-import](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-import) and `postcss-cssnext` available to use
* [BrowserSync](https://www.browsersync.io/) for live reloading of browser after
    code changes
